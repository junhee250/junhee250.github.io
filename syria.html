  	        <p><strong>&nbsp;Important Symbols/Gestures (body language)&nbsp;</strong></p>
  	        <p>- In many Arab nations, the thumbs up gesture can equal the middle finger. The older generation will tend to be more sensitive to this while the younger people might understand.&nbsp;</p>
  	        <p>- The gesture of putting your palms up with your fingertips touching (the gesture popularized by Italian culture) can mean that one is asking for patience, to add emphasis, or to ask for attention.&nbsp;</p>
  	        <p>- Measuring things with your arm is more common than using your hands. (For example, if you were trying to show the size of a bug your found with your fingers, it’s better to use your arm length.)&nbsp;</p>
           
<!--            <p class="col-xl-12">- In the Arab world, handshakes happen much more often than the West. One would shake hands every time they saw someone and every time they departed. It is more natural that handshakes are done amongst people of the same sex. If you are not comfortable with a handshake, touching your right palm to your heart can replace it as a greeting. </p>-->

<p><strong>Language<em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
            <p>- Akin to other Arab nations, Modern Standard Arabic official and most widely spoken language in Syria.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Various dialects of Levantine and Mesopotamian (Iraqi) Arabic are spoken in the West and Northeast regions of the country respectively.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Some of the smaller languages (in order of lesser speakers): Kurdish, Turkish, 4 dialects of Neo-Aramaic, Circassian, Chechen, Armenian, and Greek. None of these languages have official status in the country.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Norms (behaviors) /Customs&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>-The right hand is considered as favorable in the Islamic world; the left hand is reserved for cleaning, bathing, and hygiene. The right hand or both hands should be used for eating, waving/gesturing, offering items, and touching people. The left hand should only be used outside of its purpose when an action is inevitable. This is a custom that is widely observed throughout the Islamic world.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- If an older person enters the room, it is respectful to stand up and greet them; if there are no seats available, one should offer them their seat. It is also respectful to offer one’s seat to a woman, especially if they are with a child.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- People often each other without notice or an invitation. If this occurs, the host is expected to cease their activities and be hospitable. -Placing one’s feet on top of a table is disrespectful. Therefore, showing the soles of one’s feet are also inappropriate.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- When offered something, it is polite to decline it once before accepting it from the giver. This shows the humbleness of the receiver.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- It is considered polite to share one’s dish if they are dining with another person.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Lunch is typically eaten in the afternoon at 2:00 or 3:00 pm; it is the largest meal of the day. Dinner is often eaten late because of this.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Beliefs/Rituals/Values&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>- Most Syrians are Muslims (84% in 2021) with the majority being Sunnis and a much smaller population of Shias.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Christians (both Orthodox and Catholic groups) account for about 10% of the population.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- The rest of the population are Druzites, Jews, Yazidis, ones who practice other beliefs, and atheists.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- More devout Muslims will avoid any pork and alcohol.  &nbsp;</p>
