	  	<p>A note on the name of the country: You may be confused on why there are two different names for this country: Myanmar and Burma. Burma used to be the official name of the country until 1989, where the military government changed the English translation of the name to Myanmar in order to make the name seem more inclusive of the 135 [there are many more as well] distinct ethnic groups that are recognized by the government. Because this government lacked legitimacy during the rule, many people around the world do choose to not use Myanmar. Today, both names are widely accepted and it is okay to use both or one of the names. Although some people prefer one name or the other based on their views, using either name is tolerated. This guide will use Myanmar/Burma to encompass all views on this country.&nbsp;</p>
	  	<p>The map on the right shows how Myanmar/Burma is geographically divided. There are 15 different areas shown on the map, where 7 are regions, 7 states, and 1 union territory [territories governed by the federal government].&nbsp;</p>

Many of these people live in temporary camps in the jungle and others have tried to flee to other countries with the majority going to India and Thailand, but these countries often reject the refugees.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">- Myanmar/Burma is going through another violent ethnic conflict with an ethnic minority group, the Rohingya, who are a majority Muslim group, against the Tatmadaw. The Rohingya has had a turbulent history in Myanmar/Burma and they have been denied citizenship for over 40 years. Attacks and racism against this group from the Buddhist ethnic groups and the government had already forced over 300,000 refugees to flee to Bangladesh. The Tatmadaw’s conflict with the Rohingya started when Rohingya militants attacked Tatmadaw police posts and the Tatmadaw attacked Rohingya villages by setting burning them down, killing people, raping women, which was called a genocide by many international organizations. This conflict persists, and over 700,000 Rohingya have fled the country to neighboring South and Southeast Asian countries, but India has started deporting these refugees and Bangladesh has stopped receiving them. </p>
