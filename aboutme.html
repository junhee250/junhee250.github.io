		<hr/>
	  <p class="text-left">Hello there! I am Junhee, a current senior year student at Cherry Creek High School. I have started this project with an aim to increase tolerance and awareness of the cultures and traditions of the origin countries of the refugee and immigrant students in the CCA community. Doing research on these countries in the making of this guide has educated me on the beliefs and backgrounds of the people from these countries, and I hope that you can leave this guide with a better understanding of these students’ situations. Maybe one day, you tell a student that you have tried a dish from their native country and it makes their day. Or you greet them in their native language and you connect on a deeper level with them than just through English. Maybe you are invited to their home and need a quick heads up on some manners and customs. This guide has it all, and with current and relevant information on these cultures, you will find yourself more connected to the world. As an enthusiast in foreign languages and being an immigrant myself, I strive to spread cultural awareness and xenophilia – a love for foreign cultures – not xenophilia, at my high school. I hope the same for CCA through this guide, which will be a portal for culture. So where will you let it take you next? &nbsp;</p></div>
