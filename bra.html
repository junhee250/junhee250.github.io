	     <p class="text-left">• Brazil has seen many issues, including frequent violations of human rights, especially towards the Afro-Brazilian population, women, and the indigenous people. Police brutality is often overseen and detention centers and prisons often have very poor conditions and often have more people than the capacity, with many juveniles being detained also. These problems have worsened with the previous president who served from 2019 to 2021, Jair Bolsonaro. Afro-Brazilians and indigenous populations often experience lacking justice and equity of treatment. They have a harder time finding the money to pay for education and police brutality and racism towards these minority groups are not addressed very well. For the indigenous people’s land, there is poaching, cutting trees, and mining, which harms their land and homes. Due to this, Brazil has been poorly handling their carbon emissions and they are among the top ten largest emitters of greenhouse gases. This has led to flooding and heavy rainfall, which displaced more than 25,000 people from their homes. During his presidency, President Bolsonaro encouraged politically motivated violence against groups such as cis and transgender women, especially those in the black community, and allowed civilians to possess more firearms than the Brazilian army, navy, and air force combined. This led to the increased risk of gun violence for Brazil.</p>

       <div class="col-xl-12 col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center border-0">
	     <p class="text-left">• For 2023, the Brazilian congress voted in the favor of policies that gave the lowest funding in a decade to the Ministry of Health, which decreased the efficiency and abilities of the healthcare system to treat the people.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">• Not only is healthcare a concern, but about 180,000 people in Brazil are homeless and 68% of them are Afro-Brazilians. Furthermore, about 5.8 million people live in inadequate or housing of poor conditions, creating a greater crisis for the quality of living in Brazil.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">• In 2021, around than 63 million people were receiving minimum wage or less. This correlates to the amount of people who had severe food insecurity in 2022, who numbered as 33.1 million. 70% of this population is Black. Households in the leadership of women and Black people tend to have higher levels of food insecurity.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">• According to Data Folha, a well known polling institute in Brazil, 7 in 10 people were afraid to express their true political opinions in fear of violence and backlash. This was mainly caused by the violence towards activists, voters, and journalists.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">• Furthermore, in 2022, police brutality was severe, as the government inadequately supervised police forces. 84% of deaths from brutality were of Black people. Small crimes and suspects are often inadequately inspected nor given a chance to prove their innocence and police have higher chances of being charged minimally for their actions.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">• For women, sexual violence and domestic violence was frequently overlooked in 2022. Black and girls below 13 were common victims. According to CNN, Brazil is one of the most dangerous countries for women. There is a lot of social stigma and violence directed towards the transgender people too. Brazil is considered as one of the most dangerous and transphobic societies in the world with 100 to 300 people killed in recent years from violence. </p>
