  	    <p class="text-left">- Physical contact is very common between Venezuelans. It is natural to put the arms around someone’s shoulders as a sign of friendship. Physical contact is also often used to reinforce a point in a conversation and the type of contact depends on the context.&nbsp;</p>
  	    <p class="text-left">- Maintaining direct eye contact is important; it shows the others that you are paying attention and being respectful.&nbsp;</p>
  	    <p class="text-left">-Gesturing with the hands while talking is very common; it brings emphasis to a point or gives the conversation a sense of liveliness. Some common gestures are blowing a kiss to show affection (“lanzar besitos”- to blow kisses), indicating that you want to step outside to smoke by imitating a smoking gesture, and doing the crossing gesture to keep away a bad thought from you or another person.&nbsp;</p>
  	    <p class="text-left">- Making the okay gesture with your index finger and thumb can have a homophobic implication to it. It is considered a rude gesture.&nbsp;</p>
  	    <p class="text-left">- To point at someone or something or to beckon someone, it is considered rude to use just the index finger. Using the entire hand is more polite.&nbsp;</p>
  	    <p class="text-left">- When greeting someone for the first time, shaking hands is considered polite but when people are more acquainted, hugging and/or giving a kiss on the right cheek (between all sexes) becomes the norm.&nbsp; </p>

         <p class="text-left">- The main language of Venezuela is Venezuelan Spanish (influenced by South American and Caribbean indigenous languages, African languages, Portuguese, Italian, and English). Various other local dialects and indigenous languages are prominent in the country.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Chinese, Portuguese, Italian, and Wayuu (an indigenous language) are the other major languages spoken in Venezuela.&nbsp; </p>

         <p class="text-left">- Honesty is very important. People tend to be more open about their thoughts and emotions; having a roundabout approach to a point is common. Conversations are often loud and include a lot of lively body language; however, Venezuelans are very attentive listeners. Also, it is natural to include humor into the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Like other cultures, Venezuelans communicate differently according to the status and relationship they have with the person they are speaking to. A quieter tone is used towards a person who has a higher social standing&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- The distance of personal spacing is normally closer in Venezuela than the distance that is considered as appropriate in the West. Moving away when involved in a close interaction is considered rude.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- As the political situation in Venezuela is very complicated and as it greatly affects the lives of its people, Venezuelans are very open and willing to talk about the topic. It is best to take the topic seriously and to listen to their viewpoint and express sympathy&nbsp; </p>
         <p class="text-left">- Among Venezuelans, it is important that any form of criticism is delivered privately and not openly. Even though their conversations style if often direct and open, negative opinions are still offensive.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Usually, Venezuelans have a relaxed attitude towards timekeeping; that means social and community events can start late and continue to run over the planned time. Though in a professional/business setting, it is important to be on time.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Some informal greetings that are used commonly in Venezuela are “Epa” (Hey), “Hablalo” or “Hablame” [(Hello, how’s it going?) The whole sentence is included in this slang greeting.], “Que mas?” (What’s up?), “Que paso?” (What’s happening?), and “Que hubo” [(Hello, how are things?) Similar to Hablalo/Hablame].&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- When making a toast, the Spanish word for “cheers!” is “salud!”&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- When eating with Venezuelans, one should not eat until everyone is seated. Sometimes, the host indicated when to start with “Buen provecho” which means “enjoy” or “bon appetit.”&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Do not rest your feet on furniture; it is considered rude.&nbsp; </p>

         <p class="text-left">- Families and local communities are valued highly by Venezuelan individuals: they generally have strong relations with them.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Across Central and South America, there are a variety of different cultures and nations; one should never assume that its people are all similar. Therefore, Venezuelans would first identify proudly as Venezuelans and then as Latin Americans.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Freely questioning Venezuelans of folk beliefs or superstitions is considered as rude.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Simón Bolívar is revered and considered as a national hero by many Venezuelans; it is best to not criticize him.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Making strong statements or criticizing Hugo Chavéz and his concept of Chavismo should be avoided. These topics are sensitive, and it is best to let the Venezuelan person lead the tone of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- There is a superstitious belief that giving knives as a gift and passing salt at a dining table can bring conflict and an end to the friendship.&nbsp; </p>

		 <p class="text-left">- Millions of people in Venezuela are in severe need of basic healthcare, adequate nutrition, and other humanitarian services.&nbsp;</p>
		 <p class="text-left">- Detainees and their families are tortured brutally and are often faced with persecution. Demonstrations are violently suppressed, and the security forces of the country have raided many suspects’ homes.&nbsp;</p>
		 <p class="text-left">- Between 2016 and 2019, more than 19,000 people have been killed by the security forces, which leads to persistent fear among the population.&nbsp;</p>
		 <p class="text-left">- Most displaced Venezuelans reside in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and the United States with Colombia hosting the largest population of 1.8 million Venezuelan refugees. Since 2014, more than 6.05 million Venezuelans have fled to foreign countries. Many refugees are faced with a difficulty in obtaining a legal status, education, healthcare, and a job in foreign countries; they are also faced with xenophobia.&nbsp;</p>
         <p class="text-left">- Violent conflicts between armed groups cause the suffering of the people who are caught in the crossfire or those who are under their control.&nbsp;</p>

	     <p class="text-left">- Nicolás Maduro, the disputed current president of Venezuela, has deprived the people of basic rights and humanitarian aid. Despite pressure from international community and opposition groups, the Venezuelan government has refused to negotiate and made limited changes to its policies.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">- During the pandemic, the government used the situation to their advantage in order to gain tighter control over their people.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">- The government detains its political opponents and often disqualifies them from running for presidency. The little political freedom that is given to the people led to Nicolás Maduro’s successful presidential victory. For the government opposition parties, their leaders were replaced with government supporters.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">- As the president dominates the judiciary branch, there have been no efforts made to bring justice to the numerous human rights violations that occur in the country.&nbsp;</p>
