Ethnic elements, such as European, Amerindian, African, and Asian [Middle Eastern to East Asian] cooking and ingredients have interacted with each other and the regional differences in ethnicity and traditions have led to a range of different foods across Brazil’s vast territory.</p>

       <div class="col-xl-12 col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center border-0">
	     <p class="text-left">• Powerful criminal cartels often influence governments, especially on the local level. Through threatening and assassinating government officials, they influence elections and impact government decisions.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">• Cases of governments at various levels collaborating with organized criminal groups and cases of corruption have not been addressed enough. Violence from organized crime groups are widespread throughout the country, especially from criminal cartels. With a consistently high number of homicides, various governments claim that more than 50% of these deaths are caused by cartel violence. With a high number of human and drug trafficking, children and women are especially vulnerable to being kidnapped and used by organized crime groups. Currently 105,000 people in Mexico are missing, and investigations into these cases are extremely rare.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">• The military’s power has been increasing with the election of the current president, President Lopez Obrador, or AMLO. The military has been overseeing a greater variety of tasks of governance, such as construction and patrolling civilian and public spaces. Abuses by the military that violate the privacy of citizens have been overlooked often.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">• The police also arrest citizens for minor crimes. Those who are accused are often not given fair trials and the independence of the court from the executive branch of the government has decreased over the past few years. In prison, violence between inmates and the torture of prisoners to obtain information is frequent.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-left">• Minority ethnic groups, such as Afro-Mexicans and indigenous groups are disadvantaged socially and economically. Approximately 77% of the indigenous population lived in poverty according to 2022 data. Indigenous groups are vulnerable to violence, as they live on land that is rich in resources, and criminal groups target them for their land and resources.&nbsp;</p>
	     <p class="text-left">• Journalists and human rights defenders are often targeted by the government. There have been numerous cases of kidnappings, murders, and incarcerations without fair trials.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-left">• To look for a better life and increased employment opportunities, large numbers of families and individuals from Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador have tried to cross the border, about 64% of these people are adults. The detainment rate of migrants is extremely high, with more than 1.7 million people being detained in 2021 alone. These people are kept in detention centers that lack humanitarian items, food, and are often in locations that are not safe. Sexual abuse and poor treatment of children have been reported in these camps. </p>
